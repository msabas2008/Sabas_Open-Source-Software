				<p class="description"> <b>Open source software</b> is software with source code that <u>anyone can <br> inspect, modify, and enhance. </u> <br> <br>
				<b> Source code </b> is the part of software that most computer users <br> donâ€™t ever see; itâ€™s the code computer programmers 
				manipulate <br> to control how a program or application behaves. <br> <br> Programmers who have access to source code can change 
				a program by <u> adding to it, changing it, or fixing parts of it </u> that arenâ€™t working properly. <b> OSS </b> typically includes a 
				license that <b> allows programmers to modify the software to best fit their needs and control how the software can be distributed. </b>

			<h1 id="differences"> WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OPEN SOURCE AND CLOSED SOURCE SOFTWARE? </h1>
			<h3 id="oss"> <u>OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (OCS)</u> </h1>
			<p class="description2"> With open source software, the source code is publicly available to anyone who wants it, and 
			programmers can read or change that code if they desire. Keep in mind that you donâ€™t have to read or modify any code in
			order to use an open source product.
			</p>
			<br>
			<ul class="list2">
				<li> <b> â€¢ User-Friendliness </b> <br> Typically less user-friendly, but it can depend on the goals of the project 
				and those maintaining it. </li> <br><br>
				<li> <b> â€¢ Security </b> <br> Source code is open for review by anyone and everyone. There is a widespread theory that more eyes on the code makes it harder for bugs to 
				survive. However, security bugs and flaws may still exist and pose significant risk. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="image3">
			<img id="image3" src="../images/css.png">
			</div>
			<h3 id="css"> <u>CLOSED SOURCE SOFTWARE (OCS)</u> </h1> <br><br><br><br><br>
			<p class="description3"> But with closed source software (also known as proprietary software), the public is not given access
			to the source code, so they canâ€™t see or modify it in any way.
			</p>
			<br>
			<ul class="list3">
				<li> <b> â€¢ User-Friendliness </b> <br> Typically more user-friendly. As a for-profit product, adoptability and user experience 
				are often key considerations. </li> <br><br>
				<li> <b> â€¢ Security </b> <br> The company distributing the software (i.e., software owner) guarantees a certain level of support, 
				depending on the terms of the SLA. Because the source code is closed for review, there can be security issues. If issues are found, the software distributor is responsible for fixing them.</li>

			<h1 id="characteristics"> WHY DO PEOPLE PREFER USING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE?</h1>
			<center>
			<img id="image4" src="../images/softwareProgrammers.jpeg">
			<ul class="list4">
				<li> <b> â€¢ Control.</b> <br> Many people prefer open source software because they have more control over that kind of software. They can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't
				want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like. Users who aren't programmers also benefit from open source software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wishâ€”not 
				merely the way someone else thinks they should.</li> <br><br>
				<li> <b> â€¢ Training. </b> <br> Other people like open source software because it helps them become better programmers. Because open source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as they 
				learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can 
				share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.</li><br><br>
				<li> <b> â€¢ Security & Stability. </b> <br> Some people prefer open source software because they consider it more secure and stable than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and modify open source 
				software, someone might spot and correct errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. Furthermore, many users prefer open source software to proprietary software for important, 
				long-term projects. Because programmers publicly distribute the source code for open source software, users relying on that software for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into 
				disrepair if their original creators stop working on them. </li><br><br>
				<li> <b> â€¢ Community. </b> <br> Open source software often inspires a community of users and developers to form around it. That's not unique to open source; many popular applications are the subject of 
				meetups and user groups. But in the case of open source, the community isn't just a fanbase that buys in (emotionally or financially) to an elite user group; it's the people who produce, test, use, promote, 
				and ultimately affect the software they love.</li>
